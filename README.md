# Generics Example in Java

This Java project demonstrates the use of generics by implementing methods that work with arrays of different types. The key features of this project are:

- **Generic method `displayArray`**: Prints the elements of an array, regardless of its type.
- **Generic method `getFirst`**: Retrieves the first element from an array of any reference type.

The program shows how generics can be used to eliminate the need for multiple versions of methods for different data types. This allows for more reusable, flexible, and type-safe code.

## Features

- **Generics**: The methods are designed to work with any reference type, such as `Integer`, `Double`, `Character`, `String`, and others.
- **Array Handling**: The project demonstrates how to use arrays with different data types and how to interact with them generically.
- **Clear Documentation**: Code includes comments that explain the purpose and usage of generics in each method.

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HChristopherNaoyuki/generics-example-java.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd generics-example-java
   ```

3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file using a Java compiler.
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## Example Output
